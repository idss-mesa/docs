"""Generate llms.txt and llms-full.txt from the MESA docs/ OKF bundle.

llms.txt      — linked outline of the site (llmstxt.org convention): every
                page with its frontmatter description, grouped by the nav
                sections in zensical.toml. Each entry carries three addresses
                that return the same content — the rendered page, its Markdown
                twin (page URL + `index.md`), and the raw source on GitHub —
                because sandboxed agents often reach raw.githubusercontent.com
                when they cannot reach *.github.io.
llms-full.txt — the entire corpus concatenated as Markdown, frontmatter
                included and relative links rewritten to absolute URLs, so an
                agent can ingest the whole bundle in one fetch.

Site name, description, URL, repository, and page order all come from
zensical.toml. Both files are written into docs/ so the static build ships
them at the site root; CI regenerates them and fails if the committed copies
drift.

Usage: python scripts/gen_llms_txt.py      (from the repository root)
